## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the 0x06 Regular Expression (Regex) repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and using regular expressions, also known as regex, in various programming languages and DevOps scenarios.

Regular expressions are powerful tools that allow you to define patterns to search for, match, and manipulate text. They are widely used in programming, data processing, text searching, and many other tasks involving string manipulation. This repository aims to provide you with essential knowledge and examples to help you harness the power of regular expressions effectively.

## 2. What is Regular Expression?

A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. It provides a concise and flexible way to describe and match text patterns within strings. Regular expressions are supported in various programming languages, command-line tools, and text editors, making them a versatile tool for many applications.

In this repository, you will find explanations of regex syntax, metacharacters, quantifiers, and examples of common patterns used to match specific text formats. The knowledge provided here will enable you to perform advanced text search and manipulation tasks with ease.
