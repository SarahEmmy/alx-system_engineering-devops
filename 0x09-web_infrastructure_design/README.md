# 0x09. Web Infrastructure Design

Welcome to the 0x09 Web Infrastructure Design project! This project is designed to deepen your understanding of web infrastructure, DevOps practices, and SysAdmin concepts. The primary aim is to enhance your grasp of the key components that constitute a web stack and to improve your ability to articulate these concepts clearly and confidently.

## Project Details

- **Team Members:** Sarah Bawa, Emmy Bawa
- **Project Start:** August 24, 2023, 6:00 AM
- **Project Deadline:** September 2, 2023, 6:00 AM
- **Project Type:** Ongoing second chance project
- **Review:** Manual QA review required upon completion

## Concepts Covered

In this project, we expect you to engage with and comprehend the following essential concepts:

### DNS (Domain Name System)
Understand the role of DNS in translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses, facilitating efficient web communication.

### Monitoring
Learn about the significance of monitoring systems to track the health, performance, and availability of your infrastructure.

### Web Server
Grasp the concept of web servers as they deliver web content to users' browsers upon request.

### Network Basics
Familiarize yourself with fundamental networking concepts that underpin web communication.

### Load Balancer
Explore load balancers, which distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization and performance.

### Server
Understand servers as the backbone of web applications, serving content and executing processes based on user requests.

### High Availability Cluster
Dive into the idea of high availability clusters, where multiple servers work together to minimize downtime and ensure continuous operation.

### HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
Learn about the importance of HTTPS in securing data transmission between clients and servers.

### Firewall
Explore firewalls and their role in enhancing network security by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.

Please make sure to thoroughly read or watch the provided resources to gain a comprehensive understanding of these concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the conclusion of this project, you should be able to confidently explain the following without needing external references:

- Design a comprehensive diagram illustrating the web stack you've constructed through your SysAdmin/DevOps track projects.
- Articulate the specific purpose and functionality of each individual component depicted in your diagram.
- Define the concept of system redundancy and its significance in ensuring system reliability.
- Demonstrate your comprehension of acronyms such as LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), SPOF (Single Point of Failure), and QPS (Queries Per Second).

## Copyright and Plagiarism

It's crucial to emphasize that this project requires you to solve the tasks independently to effectively meet the stipulated learning objectives. Directly copying and pasting content from external sources is strictly prohibited and will not contribute to achieving the project's intended outcomes. Additionally, refraining from publishing any content related to this project is essential. Instances of plagiarism will result in your removal from the program.

## Project Requirements

### General

- The project necessitates the creation of a README.md file placed at the root of the project folder.
- After diagramming each task, capture a picture or screenshot of your visual representation.
- The project will undergo manual review, and tasks that have been successfully completed will be marked as green.
- Upload the screenshots of your task completions to an image hosting service and provide the corresponding links in your answer files.
- During whiteboarding sessions, convey your solutions for each task to a mentor, staff member, or fellow student without the use of computers or notes.
- Focus your explanations on the requirements outlined for each task; additional details will be explored in subsequent projects.
- Keep in mind that you have a 30-minute time frame to complete each exercise; your performance will be evaluated based on the specified requirements.
- Similar to a job interview, provide answers that directly address the interviewer's queries. If required, inquire whether delving into details is necessary, as excessive verbosity might be counterproductive.

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any uncertainties or questions during the course of the project. Best of luck as you progress through the tasks!
