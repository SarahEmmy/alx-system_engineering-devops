## Introduction

Welcome to 0x0F Load Balancer! This is a lightweight, open-source load balancer that helps distribute incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers. Load balancing is crucial for ensuring high availability, scalability, and reliability of your applications.

0x0F Load Balancer is designed to be easy to set up and configure, making it an ideal choice for small to medium-sized applications as well as larger, more complex systems. Whether you need to distribute HTTP requests, TCP connections, or UDP packets, 0x0F Load Balancer can handle it with ease.

## Features

- **Load Balancing Algorithms**: 0x0F Load Balancer supports various load balancing algorithms, including Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hash, allowing you to choose the strategy that best fits your application's needs.

- **Health Checks**: It regularly checks the health of backend servers to ensure that traffic is directed only to healthy servers, improving overall system reliability.

- **Dynamic Configuration**: The load balancer can dynamically update its configuration, allowing you to add or remove backend servers without disrupting ongoing traffic.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Detailed logging and monitoring capabilities help you keep track of the load balancer's performance and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

## Getting Started

   cd 0x0F-load-balancer
   ```

3. Build and install the load balancer:

   ```bash
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

4. Start the load balancer service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start 0x0f-load-balancer
   ```

Now you have 0x0F Load Balancer up and running!

## Usage

1. Create a configuration file to define your backend servers and load balancing strategy. An example configuration file is provided in the `examples` directory.

2. Apply your configuration using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo 0x0f-load-balancer apply /path/to/your/config/file
   ```

3. Monitor the load balancer's performance, check logs, and adjust your configuration as needed.

## Configuration

To configure 0x0F Load Balancer, create a YAML configuration file with the following structure:

```yaml
load_balancer:
  listen:
    - address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 80
  backend_servers:
    - address: 192.168.1.10
      port: 8080
    - address: 192.168.1.11
      port: 8080
  strategy: round_robin
```

You can customize the `listen` address and port, specify your backend servers, and choose a load balancing strategy. Refer to the documentation for detailed configuration options.
