A README file is a crucial component of any software project, serving as a guide for users and developers to understand the purpose and usage of the codebase. Below is an example of a README file for the 0x15-api project:

# 0x15-api

## Description

The 0x15-api project is a powerful application programming interface (API) designed to provide seamless integration between various software applications and systems. It facilitates the exchange of data and enables efficient communication between different components of a software system.

## Features

- Access to a wide range of data sets for various purposes.
- Support for both REST and GraphQL API standards.
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data privacy and integrity.
- Intuitive documentation to guide users in understanding the API endpoints and their functionalities.
- Scalable architecture that can handle a large volume of requests without compromising performance.

## Installation

To use the 0x15-api, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x15-api.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using a package manager such as npm or yarn:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the necessary environment variables for authentication and other configurations.

4. Run the server:

   ```

## Description
The aim of this project is to write automated tasks in Python instead of Bash.
Those tasks focus on getting data from an API and exporting it in JSON or CSV format.
