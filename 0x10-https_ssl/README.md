# 0x10-https_ssl

## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on configuring and setting up HTTPS (SSL/TLS) on a web server. HTTPS is used to secure communication between the client and the server, providing encryption and authentication. This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for its implementation.

## Project Requirements

- You should have a web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) installed.
- You should have an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain or subdomain.
- The web server should be configured to use HTTPS.
- Your configuration should follow best practices for SSL/TLS security.

## Files and Directories

- `0-https_abc`: A script that answers a few questions about HTTPS.
- `1-world_wide_web`: A Bash script that configures a domain with SSL/TLS using Certbot.
- `2-haproxy_ssl_termination`: A Bash script that configures an HAproxy load balancer with SSL termination.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## How to Use

Follow the steps below to set up HTTPS (SSL/TLS) on your web server:

### 0-https_abc

Run the script as follows:

```bash
./0-https_abc
```

Follow the prompts to answer questions about HTTPS.

### 1-world_wide_web

Run the script as follows:

```bash
./1-world_wide_web your_domain.com
```

Replace `your_domain.com` with your actual domain or subdomain.

The script will configure your web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to use HTTPS using Certbot for automatic certificate issuance and installation.

### 2-haproxy_ssl_termination

Run the script as follows:

```bash
./2-haproxy_ssl_termination your_domain.com
```

Replace `your_domain.com` with your actual domain or subdomain.

The script will configure an HAproxy load balancer with SSL termination.

## Resources

- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/): A free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA) that provides SSL/TLS certificates.
- [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/): A tool for automatically managing Let's Encrypt certificates.
