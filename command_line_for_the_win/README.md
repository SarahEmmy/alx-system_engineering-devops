## Background Context

**CMD CHALLENGE** is an engaging game that tests your Bash skills by challenging you with command line tasks. All tasks are completed via the command line interface, and the questions progressively increase in complexity. Participating in this project is entirely optional, and it's designed to help you improve your command line abilities.

This project is not mandatory, and it will not negatively impact your grade if you choose not to do it. However, completing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. So, if you enjoy challenges and want to enhance your command line skills, have fun and give it a try!

## Requirements

* A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
  _This project will be manually reviewed._
* As you complete each task, the name of that task will turn green.
* Capture a screenshot showing that you completed the required levels.
* Push this screenshot to GitHub with the correct filename, in either PNG or JPEG format.

Feel free to embark on this adventure and explore the fascinating world of the command line! Good luck with the challenges! ðŸš€
