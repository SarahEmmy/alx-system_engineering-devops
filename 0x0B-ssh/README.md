## Introduction

The 0x0B SSH DevOps project focuses on SSH (Secure Shell) within the realms of DevOps, Networking, System Administration, and Security. SSH is a crucial protocol for secure communication and remote management of systems. This project aims to deepen your understanding of SSH and its practical applications in various domains.

## Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project are to:

1. **Gain SSH Expertise:** Develop expertise in SSH, its protocols, configurations, and best practices.

2. **DevOps Integration:** Explore how SSH can be integrated into DevOps workflows for secure automation and remote server management.

3. **Networking Security:** Understand how SSH plays a vital role in network security, including secure remote access to devices and network equipment.

4. **System Administration:** Learn how SSH is used in system administration tasks such as remote server management, configuration, and troubleshooting.

5. **Security Best Practices:** Explore security best practices related to SSH, including key management, authentication, and encryption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of Linux/Unix systems.
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces.
- Access to a Linux/Unix-based system for hands-on tasks.
- An internet connection to access project resources and documentation.

## Project Tasks

The project tasks are designed to help you explore SSH in various contexts. You will work on tasks related to DevOps, Networking, System Administration, and Security. The tasks may include:

- Configuring SSH for secure remote access.
- Automating tasks using SSH in DevOps pipelines.
- Exploring SSH key management and authentication.
- Securing SSH configurations.
- Troubleshooting SSH connectivity issues.

Each task will have specific instructions and objectives that you should follow.

## Submission Guidelines

- Follow the instructions provided for each task carefully.
- Document your work thoroughly, including configurations and command-line outputs.
- Organize your project work into directories or files as needed.
- If the task requires code/script development, ensure that it is well-documented and structured.
- Submit your project by the project end date to meet the deadline.
- Make use of version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate if working in a team.

## Auto Review

An auto review will be launched at the project end date. Ensure that your project meets all the requirements and instructions to pass the auto review successfully.

## Resources

Use the following resources to assist you in completing the project:

- Online documentation related to SSH (OpenSSH, PuTTY, etc.).
- Online tutorials and guides on SSH.
- DevOps and security resources for SSH integration.
- Forums and community support for troubleshooting.
