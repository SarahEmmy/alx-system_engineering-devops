## Introduction
Welcome to the 0x0C Web Server project! In this project, you will delve into the world of web server development, where you will be wearing multiple hats - that of a DevOps engineer and a SysAdmin. This project will provide you with hands-on experience in setting up and configuring a web server.

## Concepts
For this project, it's crucial to understand the concept of **Child Processes**. Child processes play a significant role in web server architecture, enabling the server to handle multiple requests concurrently and efficiently. Make sure you have a solid grasp of what child processes are and how they are used in web server environments.

## Project Overview
This project challenges you to create and configure a web server. You will be responsible for setting up the server, ensuring its proper operation, and making it accessible over the internet. Your tasks will include managing child processes, handling requests, and serving web content.

## Tasks and Deliverables
Your main tasks for this project include but are not limited to:
- Setting up a web server environment.
- Configuring and optimizing the server for performance.
- Implementing child processes to handle incoming requests efficiently.
- Serving static and potentially dynamic content to clients.
- Ensuring the security and reliability of the web server.

You will be required to submit your code and configuration files, along with documentation explaining your setup and any design decisions you make.

## Resources
You may find the following resources helpful during the project:
- Online documentation for web server software of your choice.
- Tutorials and guides on web server configuration.
- Forums and communities for troubleshooting and support.

## Deadline and Submission
Remember that your project must be completed by September 27, 2023, at 6:00 AM. The checker will be released on September 25, 2023, at 6:00 PM, giving you an opportunity to validate your work before the final deadline. An auto review will also be conducted at the deadline, so ensure that your code and configuration are well-prepared.
