# 0x0E. Web Stack Debugging #1

## Description
The "0x0E. Web Stack Debugging #1" project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and is designed to help students understand and practice debugging techniques for web servers. In this project, you will be given a virtual machine with a web server (Nginx) and a WordPress site running on it. The goal is to identify and fix the issues causing the WordPress site to return a 500 internal server error.

## Project Tasks
The project consists of several tasks that involve diagnosing and fixing issues with the web server and WordPress site. Each task is focused on a specific aspect of debugging:

### Task 0: Nginx likes port 80
- Find and fix the issue that is preventing Nginx from listening on port 80.

### Task 1: Swap file
- Create a swap file and configure the system to use it to prevent out-of-memory errors.

### Task 2: Setup a domain name
- Configure the DNS settings to associate a custom domain name with the server's IP address.

### Task 3: Redirection
- Fix an issue with the WordPress site's URL redirection.

### Task 4: Not found page 404
- Customize the 404 error page for the WordPress site.

## How to Use
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Access the provided virtual machine with the web server and WordPress site.
2. Review the tasks in the project and identify the issues that need to be resolved.
